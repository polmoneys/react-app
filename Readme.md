## TLDR

Boilerplate: includes `react`, `react-router-dom`, `redux-toolkit` and `react-query`. 

## System

```@/system/components/Core``` are primitives/factories to compose specialized components out of them. 

From ```@/system/components/Core/Font``` we can export typographic components like ```<HelveticaNeue/>```or ```<HelveticaNeueXL/>```. Same with ```@/system/components/Core/Icon```.

From ```@/system/components/Core/Group``` we can export layout components like ```<Row/>```, ```<Col/>```  or ```<View/>```.

From ```@/system/components/Core/Inputs``` we can export interactive components and specialize them as ```<ButtonAccent/>```.

Working on **namings**, ```@/system/components/Pair``` is great but unless I can name it properly it will never be used by others :)
